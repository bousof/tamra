# TAMRA

**TAMRA** (Toolkit for Adaptive Mesh Refinement Applications) is a modular C++ toolkit designed to simplify the development of high-performance applications using adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) techniques.

## Features

- Flexible AMR data structures
- Efficient mesh refinement and coarsening algorithms
- Parallel processing support
- Extensible API for custom solvers and applications
- Example applications and documentation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++17 compatible compiler
- eigen-3.4.0

## Usage

Include TAMRA in your C++ project and use its API to manage adaptive meshes and perform computations.

## Documentation

See the [docs](docs/) directory for API reference and tutorials.
